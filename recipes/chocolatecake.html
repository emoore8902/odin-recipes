        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Butter three 9-inch cake rounds. Dust with flour and tap out the excess.</li>
            <li>Mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a stand mixer using a low speed until combined.</li>
            <li>Add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat on a medium speed until smooth. This should take just a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide batter among the three pans. I found that it took just over 3 cups of the batter to divide it evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes in a 350 degree oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Cool on wire racks for 15 minutes and then turn out the cakes onto the racks and allow to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Frost with your favorite frosting and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
